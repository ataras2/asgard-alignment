Installation
------------

To install all the dependencies, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

You will also need to install PySpin to work with the debugging camera. You will need to login to `FLIR's website <https://flir.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4327/~/flir-spinnaker-sdk---getting-started-with-the-spinnaker-sdk>`_ to download the SDK. Be sure to download the correct version for your operating system and python version. We have tested with `Windows Python Spinnaker SDK 4.0.0.116 3.8 (64-bit)` on Ubuntu 20.04.

Once you have downloaded the SDK, you will need to install it by calling pip install on the whl file.
